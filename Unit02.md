**Unit 2: Colonial Encounters** <span id="2"></span> 
*The “discovery” of the New World in the late fifteenth century by Spain
and Portugal inaugurated an unprecedented period of cultural encounters
stimulated by the arrival of Europeans and, later, Africans to the
Americas.  This unit examines a range of artworks – textiles and
decorative arts, religious and viceregal architecture, painting and
sculpture – that represent the diversity and, no less, the challenges of
cross-cultural engagements.  We will consider such themes as “New
World,” or creole, identities, syncretism and hybridity, and colonialism
and independence in artworks from Mexico, Peru, and Brazil.*

    the Spanish (and Portuguese) after?  
     2. How was wealth produced (i.e., how was labor organized to get at
    wealth)?  
     3. How was society organized?  How did the Spanish deal with the
    basic division of society into natives (Indians) and
    Spanish/Criollos?  
     4. What relationship existed between “Latin America” and the rest
    of the world?  
     5. At the moment of independence, what political battles had been
    decided and what remained to be fought?
