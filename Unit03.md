**Unit 3: The Modern Americas** <span id="3"></span> 
*The emergence of modernism defined modern Latin American art over the
course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Beginning with the
early constructions of American identities by European
“traveler-reporter” artists, modern Latin American art described
changing cultural and historical landscapes from Mexico to the Southern
Cone.  This unit introduces Latin American avant-gardes beginning with
the acclaimed Mexican muralists and continuing through modernist
stirrings in Brazil and Argentina.  The unit concludes with an overview
of contemporary Latin American and Latino art and a reflection on broad,
course-wide themes relating to the history and present-day identities of
Latin American art. *
