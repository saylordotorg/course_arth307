**Unit 1: The Ancient Americas** <span id="1"></span> 
*A survey of the major arts and architecture of the pre-Columbian world,
this unit introduces Mesoamerican and Andean cultures from the earliest
known civilizations to the time of European contact and conquest.  The
unit proceeds chronologically within each region, setting out “mother
cultures,” the Olmec and the Chavín, then traces the continuation of
artistic, ritual, social, and cultural practices in later
civilizations.  Seeking to debunk popular myths, from the Mayan
apocalypse to the Nazca lines, the unit explores the richness of the
pre-Hispanic tradition through study of such topics as the colossal
Olmec heads, the monumental pyramids at Teotihuacán, and Inca stonework
at Machu Picchu.*

    Research”](http://www.doaks.org/digital-humanities/publications/doaks-online-publications/pre-columbian-studies/olmec-art-at-dumbarton-oaks)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link to download the book, *Olmec Art at
    Dumbarton Oaks*.  Taube’s text begins on page 1, but do note the
    prefatory chronology and maps (pp. xv-xviii), which may be helpful
    guides.  Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in
    Washington, D.C. houses one of the premier collections of
    pre-Columbian art in the world, and its Olmec holdings are among the
    highlights.   
        
     A scholarly text, this reading surveys the history of Olmec studies
    and introduces major works and archaeological sites.  Read less for
    the details than for the broader thematic ideas and basic
    explanatory information (e.g., the explanation of the *axis mundi*,
    the discussion of different carving materials, and the conventions
    of Olmec iconography).  Be sure to scroll down to the Plates to see
    the objects referred to in the text.  This is one of the longest
    texts assigned for this course, but it provides a clear orientation
    to the nature of archaeological research and many of the terms and
    ideas that characterize our study of Mesoamerican art in general. 
    Many scholars consider the Olmec a “mother culture” for Mesoamerica,
    and we will trace their influence through the later Teotihuacano,
    Mayan, and Aztec civilizations.
