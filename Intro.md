A chronological and thematic survey of the major themes and developments
in the history of Latin American art, this course traces the evolution
of visual culture over approximately four millennia.  Organized into
three parts, the course begins with the pre-Columbian period (1800 BC to
AD 1492), moves into the years of European contact and conquest (AD 1492
to 1800), and concludes with an overview of modern and contemporary art
across the Americas.  You will learn to identify and describe works of
art and discuss the broader historical and social contexts in which they
were produced and circulated. The first part of the course will
introduce you to the major artistic achievements and archaeological
record of the ancient Mesoamerican and Andean cultures: monumental
architecture, urban planning, painting, sculpture, and portable arts. 
The study of colonial art focuses on Mexico, Peru, and Brazil,
introducing concepts of artistic hybridity and diversity, indigenous and
national cultures, and transatlantic encounters and exchange.  Turning
finally to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the course considers
artistic production in such avant-garde city-centers as Mexico City,
Buenos Aires, and São Paulo.  Throughout the course, you will consider
thematic questions relating to the expression of Latin American
identities, the relationships between art, religion, and politics, and
the nature of “non-Western” art. Building on the foundations of the Core
Program, Arts of Latin America offers a focused survey of art that is
often excluded from conventional canons of the field.  If you are
familiar with Western Art History, this course will expose you to a
fascinating, parallel history of art that challenges and enriches your
knowledge of how art evolved globally over time.
